  Default module for prioritizing network interfaces

  The priority order is:

  1. Internet-connected interfaces are chosen before LAN-connected interfaces
  2. Wired Ethernet, then wifi, then mobile and then any other interfaces
  3. The interface's weight is used to resolve ties. By default, the weight is
     derived from the interfaces index. E.g., `eth0`'s weight is 0 (highest priority)
     and `eth1`'s weight is 1 (next highest)
