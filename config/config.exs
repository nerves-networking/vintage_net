# Overrides for unit tests:
#
# * udhcpc_handler: capture whatever happens with udhcpc
# * udhcpd_handler: capture whatever happens with udhcpd
# * interface_renamer: capture interfaces that get renamed
# * resolvconf: don't update the real resolv.conf
# * path: limit search for tools to our test harness
# * persistence_dir: use the current directory
# * power_managers: register a manager for test0 so that tests
#      that need to validate power management calls can use it.
#
# NOTE: the power_managers list here exercises common error cases
# that would cause exceptions, but instead print logs so that
# they don't take down an otherwise working system. This leads
# to extra prints when running locally.
